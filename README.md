# Storybook-Animate

Storybook is great for designing indivdual states of your application's components.
But your users don't see your app as individual states, but a series of states that flow together over time. If storybook lets you design the frames, Storybook-Animate lets you create the flipbook!

## Simplicity Breeds Creativity

Where you used to provide a story of a single component with props:

```js
storiesOf('Thermometer', module)
  .add('Healthy Temperature', () => (
    <Thermometer scale="F" temp={98.6}> 
  ))
```

You can animate the component with a `propStream`

```js
storiesOf('Thermometer', module)
  .add('Healthy Temperature', () => (
    <Animate
      component={Thermometer}
      propStream={climbingTemp}
    />    
  ))
```

And here is the beautiful result:

Try clicking on the animation to restart it, or using `<Animate loop={true} ... />` to just sit back and admire your animation :)

## Dive into Streams
A `propStream` is an [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) Observable, created any way you like. But to ease you in,  Storybook-Animate includes some helpers to supplement those provided by Rx-Helper:

```js
const climbingTemp = sequenceOf(
  after(0.0, { temp: 86 }),
  after(1000, { temp: 92 }),
  after(1000, { temp: 96 }),
  after(1000, { temp: 99 }),
  after(1000, { temp: 100.5 }),
  after(1000, { temp: 102.2 })
).combineWith({scale: "F"})
```

## Storybook Your API calls, Loading States, API Errors

Sometimes your users see loading states for a lot longer than you are able to during developmentâ€”why not have stories for those loading states too? Feel their pain, and design to improve upon it right there in your UX design tool. 

Like this example from a recent Storybook:

Here's how:
</summary>

Imagine an oversimplified auto-complete component such as this one.

```js
import { searchApi } from './anotherFile'

function AutoComplete() {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([])
  return (
    <input onChange={(e) => {
      searchApi(e.target.text)
        .then(results => setResults(results))
    }/>
    { /* render results */ }
  )
}
```

It calls `searchApi`, a Promise-returning function, to get results, which are objects like `{text: 'Boom', value: 25}`. It then changes internal state with those results to cause a re-render. To simulate a slow state, the first thing we must do is make the component _default_ to using the search function it used before, but make it overridable as a prop.

```js
import {searchApi} from './anotherFile'
function AutoComplete({ searchFunction = searchApi }) {
  ...
}
```

Now it will call searchApi by default _unless_ another function is provided. Let's provide one. Here's a mock function that, after a delay of 3000 msec, returns the array we'd get from the real service.

```js
const slowSearch = term => after(3000, [
  {text: 'Abacus', value: 1},
  {text: 'AbbA', value: 2}
])).toPromise()
```

And now let's hand this function in to AutoComplete in our storeis.
Now AutoComplete can display the results we want, when we want them! 

```js
storiesOf('Autocomplete', module)
  .add('Regular Loading', () => (
    <AutoComplete/>
  ))
  .add('Slow Loading', () => (
    <AutoComplete searchFunction={slowSearch} />
  ))
```

Why not add mock functions for failed lookups as well? This will make you think, and plan for it. All without leaving Storybook, thanks to Storybook-Animate, and RxJS Observables.

## The Sky's The Limit!

You can combine Storybook-Animate with other means of animations. CSS animations, React Transition Groups internal to your components - you are only limited by what you can come up with!

Got ideas that we haven't thought of? Search for an issue or open one if you don't see it.

## Examples

The Thermometer example is in the `stories/` folder of this project. Feel free to post a link to what you've built with it too, we can include it here!
